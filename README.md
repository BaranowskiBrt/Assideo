# Assideo

PyTorch utilities for image matching and resemblance detection using deep learning. The ArcFace, CosFace and Softmax functions are available in the [loss.py file](https://github.com/BaranowskiBrt/Assideo/blob/main/assideo/loss.py).

Example of how to use the library can be found in the lfw_train.py for training, lfw_predict.py for inference and lfw_draw_metrics.py for comparing multiple setups.
